# MAGIC # Welcome to the Wild West Hackathon
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Thank you so much for your participation in this event.  We at Blueprint are so excited to have you here.  If you are reading this, then you are on a team participating in Challenge #2.  The goal of Challenge #2 will be to complete **1** data science/artificial intelligence quest.  In this folder you will find 3 other notebooks that will help you get started with each quest.  This is your team's folder.  You can create additional notebooks here as needed.  However, everything you create should be related to the competition.  No weirdly clever bitcoin mining notebooks please!  Also, things should be segmented in such a way that you won't be interfering with other teams.  This is a **friendly** competition, so please do not attempt to work around this segmentation to adversely affect other participants.

# MAGIC ### Challenge Details
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You are a data science consultant being brought into Adventure Works for their 3 most pressing iniatives. The details of each initative are located in quest notebooks. The **business explanation** will be the highest weighted when calculating quest completion score.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Very Important** There are multiple ways to solve each quest. We have provided you with the historical data that we think you will need, but if your solution requires additional data, please ask. Additionally, streams for applying predictors will only be available after you have submitted your planning section to ensure that the stream format matches your solution. Submit plans to David Wood in Teams.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Please submit your quest(s) in **Python** for this challenge. **Note:** Contact us if you absolutly must use a different language.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is a *canned* hackathon.  We provide you with the starting point and also have a specific expectation of the ending point.  You are responsible for everything in between. Once again, these are specified in the individual quest notebooks.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Very Important** Submit all data stream predictions in one table with all original columns plus your prediction. There may be more than one type of prediction per Quest and those should be in separate tables.

# MAGIC ### Help
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We want this to be a fun and educational experience for everyone.  If can be difficult to find the fun when you get stuck, and when you are doing data science work, there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck.  While fighting through those challenges is often times the best way to learn, we don't want anyone to feel that they are too stuck to finish.  As such, help is available should you need it.  At the time of writing this, not all of the details have been finalized for getting help.  However, you can email me at dwood@bpcs.com as needed.  I may not always be able to help right away, but I will try to get you moving in the right direction.
